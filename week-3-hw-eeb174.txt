QUESTION 1
	1.  61 times the levels of individual 3 was recorded
		command: cut -f 1 Gesquiere2011_data.csv |grep -c -w 3
		this cuts the first column which is the men ID and grep takes and counts the number the ID3 was recorded.

		5 times the levels of individual 27 was recorded 
		command: cut -f 1 Gesquiere2011_data.csv |grep -c -w 27
	
	2. first we write a script using gedit and save it as a .sh in the scrept folder: 
	 	 #! /bin/bash
		cut -f 1 $1 | grep -c -w $2
		this will cut the first column which is the male ID (variable 1), and then grep -c -w will count the number of records which would be variable 2. using grep --w is needed to not grep for example ID of 77 when $1 is 7. 
	    	to give execute permission we can run:    chmod u+x week-3-hw.sh 
	3. script :
		#! /bin/bash
		menID=$(tail -n +2 Gesquiere2011_data.csv | cut -f 1 | sort -n | uniq)
		for ID in $menID
		do
 			number=$(cut -f 1 Gesquiere2011_data.csv |grep -c -w $ID)
 			echo "ID $ID was $number times sampled"
		done
		first we want the first column which is the menID to be sorted numerically, also we use uniq to not have duplicates. then for this column we use a loop count each id.
